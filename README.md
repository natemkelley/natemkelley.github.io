This portfolio is largely based on the graphic design work of one of my favorite designers http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/. However, this portfolio is created in scalable Vue components and any of Rob's art has been recreated as scalable SVG images. All art in this repo is free game. Also, this repo is public and anyone is free to fork it and do a portfolio of their own. Have at it world.
